First you'll need to prepare Slack to receive incoming webhooks. Then you'll create an action in TableFlow that triggers this newly created webhook in Slack.

## Configure Incoming Webhook in Slack

Slack offers a handy feature that enables developers to use webhooks to send messages. Slack calls these "apps", but in this case they're really just lightweight actions.

#### 1. Create Slack App
Follow [this link](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app) and click the "Create New App" button to get started. Then select "From scratch" to continue to the configuration page.

#### 2. Congifure App
You can name the app anything you like, but we suggest "TableFlow". Then select the Slack Workspace where the messages will be sent.

#### 3. Activate Webhook Functionality
Under the "Features and functionality" section, find and click on the "Incoming Webhooks" option. Find the "Activate Incoming Webhooks" setting and switch the toggle to "On".

#### 7. Copy Webhook URL
Great, now you've got a Slack App that's ready to receive incoming webhooks. Scroll to the bottom of the "Incoming Webhooks" page and use the "Copy" button to copy the webhook URL.

## Create TableFlow Webhook

Now that you've got the incoming webhook ready in Slack, you can now trigger it from TableFlow.

#### 1. Add Endpoint
Navigate to the "Webhooks" section of the TableFlow settings and click the "Add Endpoint" button.

#### 3. Enable Transformations
Navigate to the "Advanced" section of the endpoint settings and find "Transformations". Toggle on the "Enabled" switch.

#### 4. Edit Transformation Code
Click "Edit transformation" and find the code block to modify the webhook payload. Update the handler to the code below and click "Save".
```
function handler(webhook) {

  webhook.payload = {"text": "TableFlow Import Completed - number of rows: " + webhook.payload.num_rows}

  return webhook
}
```

## Try It Out ðŸŽ‰
That's it! If everything's set up correctly, you should be good to go. Import a new file and check to see if your new Slack app sent a message to the channel you defined.
